# Challenge 1 - Read a resource from a RESTful API
In this challenge you will make an HTTP GET request to a RESTful API in order to obtain some data from the API

In IT, self-learning is a crucial skill. While you'll have teammates in the Managed Services team to assist you, it's valuable to try solving problems independently first. We frequently encounter new technologies, requiring even seasoned engineers to engage in self-learning to excel in their roles.

This challenge integrates self-learning with acquiring fundamental skills in communicating with a RESTful API.

## Prerequisites
### Http
You should have a basic understanding of HTTP. 
If you do not feel you have much knowledge around HTTP check out this short video:

[Learn in 5 Minutes: HTTP Headers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v7RoeXyww4)

### REST APIs
You will need a basic understanding of REST APIs, what they are and what they do.

### Tooling
There are many tools you can use to send HTTP requests to a REST API. 
You can use command line tools like: 

**curl**

[curl](https://curl.se/) is included out of the box if using bash or PowerShell

curl is most commonly used for when you want to quickly make HTTP requests form the command line or want to make HTTP requests in a bash script. 

<br>

**PowerShell**

You can use the `Invoke-RestMethod` cmdlet in [PowerShell](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell)

This is most commonly used for when you want to quickly make HTTP requests from the command line using PowerShell or if you want to make HTTP requests in a PowerShell script. 

<br>

Alternatively you can use a GUI based tool like:

**Postman**

[Postman](https://www.postman.com/) is commonly used for testing REST APIs and allows you to create collections of HTTP requests that you can trigger when needed. 

**Note:** We use Postman in Managed Services for these purposes so it is useful to have it set up whether you intend to use it for this challenge or not. 

## The Challenge
Make use of the learning resources in the prerequisites above if needed to gain a better understanding of the technologies you are working with. 
You are not limited to those learing resources only, feel free to use google or any other resource you like if you need to learn more. 

Make an HTTP GET request to the [icanhazdadjoke](https://icanhazdadjoke.com/api) API to retreive a random Dad Joke. 

Once you have the response, post the whole response object to me and I will verfiy that you completed the challenge successfully. 

If you have made your best attempt at figuring this out for yourself and are still unable to complete the challenge, that's okay! Reach out to the team for some help. It's all a learnng process. The important thing here is that you have made your best effort. 

Have fun learning!
